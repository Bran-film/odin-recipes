      "While tarator soup may be loved nationwide, many regard shopska salad as
      the Bulgarian national dish; it has rapidly become a national culinary
      symbol of Bulgaria since it was created in the 1950s. Every color of
      Bulgariaâ€™s flag is displayed in the dish through its ingredients. The
      salad, which has won a Taste of Europe contest in the past, usually
      contains a mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olive oil,
      and grated white sirene cheese, which is said to be the key ingredient to
      giving the salad its unique flavor. Like tarator soup, this cold salad is
      frequently served during summer. This is easily the most recognizable dish
      in Bulgaria, regardless of which variety you choose. You may find a few
      variations being offered around the country, some of which may contain
      extras like mushrooms or eggs."
