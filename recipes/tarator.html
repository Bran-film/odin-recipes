        <h2>Tarator</h2>
        <p>
          "Moving on to the heavy hitters of Bulgarian cuisine, tarator soup is
          a standout dish and easily one of the most famous Bulgarian dishes.
          You’ll quickly discover that tarator soup is listed on nearly every
          Bulgarian menu.<br /><br />
          A ubiquitous sight during the warm summer months, this chilled soup is
          simple, light, and very refreshing. Commonly served as a first course,
          tarator soup may be your initial introduction to authentic Bulgarian
          cooking when you arrive. <br /><br />
          Traditional tarator soup usually contains a blend of the beloved
          unique Bulgarian yogurt, chopped dill, cucumbers, sunflower oil, and
          maybe a bit of garlic. Cold water or ice cubes are added to make it
          all that more refreshing. <br /><br />
          Some varieties may see the soup topped with walnuts for a bit of a
          crunch, and there’s a salad version of the soup that omits watering
          down the yogurt. "

          <li class="steps-list">
            Beat the yogurt with a fork until it gets liquid and pour it over
