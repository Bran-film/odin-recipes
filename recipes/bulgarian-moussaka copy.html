        <h2>Bulgarian Moussaka</h2>
        <p>
          "It is jokingly said in Bulgaria that a suitable partner must know how
          to make good Bulgarian moussaka. <br /><br />
          Moussaka may be considered more Greek, but the Bulgarians have their
          own unique recipe, which is adored throughout the country.
          <br /><br />
          Bulgarian moussaka substitutes the traditional eggplant found in the
          Greek variety with potatoes and contains minced or ground meat, egg,
          and sometimes mushrooms. <br /><br />
          This traditional Bulgarian food is easy to make and is incredibly
          delicious. Some recipes call for a topping of yogurt for a bit of a
          tangy flavor, while others choose to top their moussaka with cheese."

            Cut the cucumbers into cubes and put them in a bowl. You may also
            grate them but it changes the look and the consistency.

            Beat the yogurt with a fork until it gets liquid and pour it over
