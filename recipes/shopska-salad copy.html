        <h2>Shopska Salad</h2>
        <p>
          "While tarator soup may be loved nationwide, many regard shopska salad
          as the Bulgarian national dish; it has rapidly become a national
          culinary symbol of Bulgaria since it was created in the 1950s.
          <br /><br />
          Every color of Bulgariaâ€™s flag is displayed in the dish through its
          ingredients. The salad, which has won a Taste of Europe contest in the
          past, usually contains a mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, bell
          peppers, olive oil, and grated white sirene cheese, which is said to
          be the key ingredient to giving the salad its unique flavor.
          <br /><br />
          Like tarator soup, this cold salad is frequently served during summer.
          This is easily the most recognizable dish in Bulgaria, regardless of
          which variety you choose. You may find a few variations being offered
          around the country, some of which may contain extras like mushrooms or
          eggs."

            Cut the cucumbers into cubes and put them in a bowl. You may also
            grate them but it changes the look and the consistency.
