      "It is jokingly said in Bulgaria that a suitable partner must know how to
      make good Bulgarian moussaka. Moussaka may be considered more Greek, but
      the Bulgarians have their own unique recipe, which is adored throughout
      the country. Bulgarian moussaka substitutes the traditional eggplant found
      in the Greek variety with potatoes and contains minced or ground meat,
      egg, and sometimes mushrooms. This traditional Bulgarian food is easy to
      make and is incredibly delicious. Some recipes call for a topping of
      yogurt for a bit of a tangy flavor, while others choose to top their
      moussaka with cheese."
