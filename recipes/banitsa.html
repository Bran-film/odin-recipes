        <h2>Banitsa</h2>
        <p>
          "Banitsa, sometimes written as banitza, is not only one of Bulgaria’s
          most famous foods but also one of its most versatile. This baked
          pastry can be served hot or cold and can be made to be sweet or
          savory. <br /><br />
          Banitsa comprises layered sheets of buttered filo pastry containing
          eggs and, most commonly, a white cheese known as sirene as a filling.
          <br /><br />
          It is a common Bulgarian breakfast item, but the sweeter varieties
          filled with ingredients like apples, pumpkin, or walnuts are often
          enjoyed as popular Bulgarian desserts. <br /><br />
          While this may be one of the rare high-calorie Bulgarian cuisine
          items, you can opt for varieties filled with spinach, onions, leeks,
          or cabbage as a healthier option. You’ll often see people eating
          banitsa with a side of yogurt, and during the festive winter season,
          the pastry usually contains good luck charms or coins."
