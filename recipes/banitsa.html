      "Banitsa, sometimes written as banitza, is not only one of Bulgaria’s most
      famous foods but also one of its most versatile. This baked pastry can be
      served hot or cold and can be made to be sweet or savory. Banitsa
      comprises layered sheets of buttered filo pastry containing eggs and, most
      commonly, a white cheese known as sirene as a filling. It is a common
      Bulgarian breakfast item, but the sweeter varieties filled with
      ingredients like apples, pumpkin, or walnuts are often enjoyed as popular
      Bulgarian desserts. While this may be one of the rare high-calorie
      Bulgarian cuisine items, you can opt for varieties filled with spinach,
      onions, leeks, or cabbage as a healthier option. You’ll often see people
      eating banitsa with a side of yogurt, and during the festive winter
      season, the pastry usually contains good luck charms or coins."
